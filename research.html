					<p>During my reseach, I learned that the Pickens County Shelter of Hope is actually the first homeless shelter in Pickens, SC. It was made possible thanks to local supporters, businesses, and churches who came together to create a safe and welcoming shelter for those in need. I would like my website to highlight how the community came together for this project, and how it has impacted the lives of those who work there and those who have recieved help from the shlelter.</p>
					<p>There are some website elements I would like to keep and modify, such as the About us, Meet the team, Donate, Volunteer, and Shop sections. I would also like to emphasize some specific elements such as the connect the dots visual element, and the About us section to make it more interactive and personal. And lastly, I would like to add a resources tab, hours of service, and social media tab to cater to the intended audience.</p>
					<p>Below are images of published material on the Pickens County Shelter of Hope website, as well as their facebook page; including advertisements for fundraisers, website elements, and logos.</p>

					<h4>Step 1: Explore the most recent news in your client's field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, or journals to know what’s new. </h4>
					<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/evictions-south-carolina-signal-dire-straits-renters-nationwide-homelessness-looms-n1236224"target=_blank> NBC News</a> South Carolina has had the highest eviction rates in the US, and the people continue to suffer homelessness and face the perils of the housing crisis. This pain is further emphasized by the trials of job loss and eviction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With families unable to afford rent or go out and risk the health of themselves or their family, the problem of homelessness in the area has only grown.</p>
					<img src="Research Images/chart.png"/>
					<p> <a href="https://www.schomeless.org/media/1163/scich-report-731-final-draft-electronic.pdf"target=_blank>The South Carolina State of Homeless Report</a> further states that "The economic impact of the pandemic has led to increased job losses, threats of evictions due to lack of income to cover housing costs, including basic utilities, and evictions. The result has been increased homelessness and housing instability". These individuals are found to also be those that fall into high-risk groups for having health issues such as pre-existing health conditions that makes it even harder for them to secure a job or shelter, thus putting themselves and others at even higher risk when they must share living spaces in shelters or at the homes of family or friends.
					</p>
					<p> Research from the <a href="https://www.usich.gov/homelessness-statistics/sc/"target=_blank>Unite States Interagency Council of Homelessness</a> provides statistics of which people groups experience homlessness, as well as how many people are found to be without shelter. Included bleow is an informational diagram containing key points and statistics of the research.</p>

				<h4>Step 2: Try to find recent innovations in your client's field: technical, behavioral, or cultural.
				</h4>
				<p> <a href="https://schoolhouseconnection.org/efsa-reintroduced/"target=_blank>The School House Connection</a> has kept updates on their website regarding legislative and government aid for the homeless community during the Pandemic. One of the more recent updates being on Febuary fouth announcing the Emergency Family Stabilization Act. The goal of this act is to provied, "flexible funding directly to community-based organizations to meet the needs of children, families, and unaccompanied youth who are experiencing homelessness (as defined by the education definition of homelessness) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These children, youth, and families have been largely left out of previous coronavirus legislation – yet they are highly mobile, stay in crowded places, and are at high risk of transmission, illness, and other harms. EFSA fills the gap by providing flexible emergency funding to the agencies that are closest to children, youth, and families. Helping children, youth, and families through the systems to which they are most connected will stabilize them quicker and more effectively, and prevent long-term homelessness".</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.urban.org/features/covid-19-policies-protect-people-and-communities#chapter-1"target=_blank>The Urban Instite</a> website features a page dedicated solely to COVID-19 Policies to Protect People and Communities, providing resources such as guides to state and local responses, lists of child care services and data analyses, child care and education resources, fiscal and economic resources, and health policy resources.</p>
				<h4>Step 3: Look at other solutions. Which worked? Which didn't? Any similar solutions?
				</h4>
				<p>The Transitions homeless shelter website has some very effective elements I would like to incorporate into my design such as a cohesive and consistent color palette and typeface, a display with statistics of how much the organization has provided to the community and expanded, and a clear and direct home page that clearly states the purposes, goals, and has effecient and clear navigation guides.</p>
				<div class="image fit">
				<img src="Research Images/website good.png"/>
				<img src="Research Images/good website 2.png"/>
			</div>
				<p>The Homeless Shelter Directory website does not effeciently or effectively connect with the user. The bright red and blue colors stand out too much and are a harsh contrast to the rest of the black type and white background. There is also a lack of clear navigation and visual hierarchy with elements surrounding on all sides and having information being thrown to the viewer all at the same time. There is also some chaos on the page with the animated ads that can distract the user and takes away from the experience.</p>
			
			<div class="image fit">
				<img src="Research Images/bad website.png"/>
			</div>
				<h4>Step 4: Any data that is relevant.
				</h4>
				<p>According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness,The Biden Administration and Congress will have immediate opportunities to prioritize homelessness and housing in 2021. This includes appointing key Cabinet officials who are dedicated to evidence-based and equity-based approaches to ending homelessness, including Housing First. It includes advancing a FY 2021 Federal budget that dramatically scales up investments in the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Grants program. This will be crucial as states and localities deal with lost revenue and diminished budgets following the pandemic. And it includes the Biden Administration’s campaign goal to expand the Housing Choice Voucher program (Section 8) so that more people can afford housing.</p>
				<p>There is also notable research that the homeless population is at its height among two age groups, those who are realtively young, and the elderly. The  youth that are experiencing homelessness need to make good connections and network to reduce the chance of stretching their situation into a longer span of homelessness.</p>
