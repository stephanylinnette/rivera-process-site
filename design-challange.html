					<h3>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h3>
					<p>Homelessness in Pickens, SC.</p>
					<h3>Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</h3>
					<p>What resources can the Pickens County Shelter of Hope provide to the local homeless community?</p>
					<h3>Now state the ultimate impact you're trying to have.</h3>
					<p>To provide shelter, support, and guidance to the local homeless community.</p>
					<h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?.</h3>
					<p>Publish more resources for those who need services, not just options for volunteer and donations, call to action for those who would like to support the ministry, food drives and other events to provide more help, resources for jobs and networking opportunities for those in need.</p>
					<h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you're facing.</h3>
					<p>Due to COVID-19, it can be difficult to provide a safe space for more individuals, limited space, and fundraising opportunities are also obstacles that we are facing. As well as getting enough supplies to keep everyone safe and healthy when some products are limited and sharing is not allowed.</p>
					<h3>Does you original questions need a tweak? Try it again.</h3>
