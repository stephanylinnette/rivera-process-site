						<p class="info">Determining who is the Audience and how the website can be designed to cater to their individual needs.</p>
					</header>
                    <p>To start determining who the main audience is, we were required to complete a brainstorming exercise in which we categorized everyone involved with the the organization from direct to indirect involvement and really dig into who we are designing for. To do this exercise we used brightly colored sticky notes to categorize all those involved with the organization. Below is a picture of my completed exercise.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>I started out by identifying the donors and supporters of the shelter, most of which I found out were local people and businesses, such as the local gym, J.B. Red Owens Complex, Clemson University, Pickens High School, Lowes, and Goodwill, among many other local businesses. The volunteers for the shelter were also locals, such as high school students, Clemson University students, former homeless people, current residents, and local bus drivers.</p>
                        <p>I then identified those that were directly and indirectly involved (peripherally relevent), I was not suprised by what I found in my research for who was directly involved, however for the peripherally relevant, I learned that the shelter will sometimes partner with the Pickens County Dream Center and local food pantries to help their residents, I think this is a very important feature that should be adressed in the website with what services and networking opportunities the shelter provides to their residents</p>
                        <p>The hardest audience to identify were the skeptics. The shelter has such a good cause, that I found it hard to believe anyone could be against the idea, however upon further research, I learned that the shelter had a previous location but had to move out on short notice after the neighbors kept filing complaints to the landlord that they did not like to live near a shelter. I also learned that there were people opposed to the shelter who did not think it was necessary because Pickens had never had a shelter and there were other organizations and ministries in the town that could provide for the homeless. It is important to adress this audience and learn how I can change that perspective of the shelter using design and content.</p>
